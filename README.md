Adyton
======

Adyton is an event-driven network simulator, written in C++, for Opportunistic Networks (a.k.a. Delay-Tolerant Networks) that is capable of processing contact traces.
The Adyton simulator supports a plethora of routing protocols and real-world contact traces, while also providing several congestion control mechanisms and buffer management policies.

Adyton was developed by [Nikolaos Papanikos](http://cse.uoi.gr/~npapanik) and [Dimitrios-Georgios Akestoridis](http://cse.uoi.gr/~dakestor) during their graduate studies in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Ioannina, Greece](http://cse.uoi.gr) under the supervision of Prof. [Evangelos Papapetrou](http://cse.uoi.gr/~epap).

> Adyton was a restricted area within Ancient Greek temples, where oracles and priests gave their oracular responses.

<a name="note1">1</a>: Note that the original traces are not directly supported by Adyton. Further processing is required for each trace in order to be compatible with Adyton. More instructions about trace processing can be found in the utils/trace-processing directory. For any questions or special requests please contact us.

<a name="note2">2</a>: Currently all congestion control mechanisms and some scheduling policies are supported only by single-copy routing protocols. Their use in multi-copy protocols is still experimental.

<a name="note3">3</a>: Deletion mechanisms are used only in the case of multi-copy routing protocols where multiple packet replicas exist throughout the network.


Installation
------------

**Requirements**

Adyton currently supports only Linux-based systems with a proper C++ compiler.
All the required third-party libraries are included in the ext/ directory.

**Compiling**

To compile Adyton from source code, just execute the following command inside the src/ directory:
```
$ make
```

**Execution**

After compiling Adyton from source code, you can use the executable file to run a simulation with the default settings with the following command:
```
$ ./Adyton
```

```<number of packets>``` is the number of packets that will be created.

```<time to live>``` is defined as a timeout value, which specifies when a packet is no longer useful and should be deleted (if <time to live> is equal to 0, the TTL value will be infinite).

```<buffer size>``` is defined as the maximum number of packets that each node can store (if <buffer size> is equal to 0, infinite buffers will be used).

```<replication number>``` is the replicas of each original packet (used only for multi-copy protocols).

```<number of pieces>``` is the number of pieces to split the contact trace file, before uploading to memory.

```<seed number>``` is used by the pseudo-random number generator algorithm.

```<text file>``` is the name of a text file with additional parameter arguments.

```<results directory>``` is the name of the directory that will store the results of the simulation.

```<trace directory>``` is the name of the directory that stores the contact trace files.
